420,440,TISTUD-1523,fail jenkins build if studio contains jdt plugins,as a way of keeping ourselves from accidentally releasing jdt into the wild as part of studio we need to fail the aptana studio and titanium studio builds if either the plugin or standalone versions come packaged with the jdt plugins this prevents halfbaked jdt installs which hen keep a user from later installing the whole jdt proper for module development,8,appceleratorstudio

11630,12775,MDL-44366,filter_glossary has the potential to be slow on large sites,as a followon to mdl43524 which removed global text caching we need to examine the glossary filter and probably add muc caching there to improve performance the glossary filter is what puts links in texts to glossary entries there is quite a lot of processing going on in the background even before the simple text replacement and this needs to be redone every time the cache is invalidated petr has raised that the fully correct way would be to use new events or the asyetunwritten hooks to invalidate the caches but i think that might be too much to do before 27 so i want to see a quick solution here even if it may mean relying on lessperfect cache invalidation this issue requires performance comparison tests before and after the fix,40,moodle
11631,12776,MDL-44368,filter_activitynames can be improved after dropping of global text cache,as a followon to mdl43524 which removed global text caching we need to examine the activity names filter and probably add muc caching there to improve performance the activitynames filter is what puts links in texts to other activities in the same course petr has raised that the fully correct way would be to use new events or the asyetunwritten hooks to invalidate the caches but i think that might be too much to do before 27 so i want to see a quick solution here even if it may mean relying on lessperfect cache invalidation tests showing performance beforeafter are required,20,moodle

16023,17605,XD-2996,align spring xd partitioning with kafka partitioning for the kafka message bus,as a developer i want that the spring xd partitioning process targets kafka bus partitions directly so that the design of my stream processing application is easier to understand and the order of messages is not altered current situation spring xd partitioning logic that builds on top of kafka partitioning the number of spring xd partitions is not explicitly configured if the concurrency of the consumer modules is 1 then spring xd partitions are matched 11 with kafka partitions if the concurrency of the consumer modules is n then a spring xd partition uses n kafka partitions and the message bus distributes messages across the kafka partitions that correspond to the spring xd partitions this could be confusing to the end user especially if they are used to the kafka partitioning process this can also lead to changes of ordering between messages as messages within the same spring xd partitions will be sent to different kafka partitions improvement for the kafka message bus the number of spring xd partitions does not need to be equal to the number of modules and should be configured explicitly using the partitioncount property as a result in the case of kafka there will always be a 11 match between kafka partitions and spring xd partitions optionally processed by fewer modules than the partition count,5,springxd
